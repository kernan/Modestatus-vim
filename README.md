# Modestatus

Modestatus is (yet another) statusline replacement aimed at users who prefer a more hands-on approach to customization.

It includes APIs for:
- Creating statusline parts.
- Modifying existing highlight groups
- Adding named colors that can be applied to statusline parts
- Adding part-specific formatting options including colors
